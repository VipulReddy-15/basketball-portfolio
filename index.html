<h2 style="background-color: beige;text-align: justify;">ABOUT THE TEAM </h2>
<p style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;color: beige;font-style: italic;"> The Golden State Warriors are an American professional basketball team based in San Francisco. The Warriors compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Pacific Division of the Western Conference. Founded in 1946 in Philadelphia, the Warriors moved to the San Francisco Bay Area in 1962 and took the city's name, before changing its geographic moniker to Golden State in 1971. The club plays its home games at the Chase Center.</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;color: beige;font-style: italic;">The Warriors won the inaugural Basketball Association of America (BAA) championship in 1947, and won again in 1956, led by Hall of Fame trio Paul Arizin, Tom Gola, and Neil Johnston. After the trade of star Wilt Chamberlain in January 1965, the team finished the 1964–65 season with the NBA's worst record (17–63). Their rebuilding period was brief due in large part to the Warriors' drafting of Rick Barry four months after the trade. In 1975, star players Barry and Jamaal Wilkes powered the Warriors to their third championship, widely considered one of the biggest upsets in NBA history. </p>

    </br>

        No other words are needed.
    </br>

        With 0.6 seconds remaining in overtime and the score tied at 118-118 against the host Oklahoma City Thunder on Saturday, Golden State Warriors superstar Stephen Curry did what he always seems to do—hit a shot from another universe.
</br>
        
        The reigning MVP pulled up from 32 feet out and buried it. Russell Westbrook subsequently missed a triple on the other end.
</br>
        Game over, 121-118.
        Curry's 12th bomb of the night added to his new single-season record for three-pointers (288), and it tied the record for the most in a game.
</br>
        Once again, ladies and gentlemen: Steph. </p>
